                <h3>Rich in Antioxidants</h3>
                <p>
                    Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as sweet treat. But specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.

                <h4>Natural Cough Medicine</h4>
                <p>
                    Honey is a time-honored remedyfor sore throat. According to one study, it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that contan dextromethrophan (DM), a cough supressant. You can create your own remedy at home by mixing  up to 2 teaspoons of honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon.

                <h4>Lowers Blood Pressure</h4>
                <p>
                    Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans have shown reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.

            <div>
                <h4>Improves Cholestrol</h4>
                <p>
                    Studies have shown consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholestrol by 6-11%. Honey may increase HDL (good) cholestrol by about 3%.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Improves Improves Health</h4>
                <p>
                    It's high antioxidants, such as phenolic acid and flavonoids, which may support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants could help improve cholestrol levels, which could help decrease the risk of heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm those findings.

            <div>
                <h4>Antibacterial properties</h4>
                <p>
                    Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level. This works to help pull moisture away from the bacteria to get dehydrated and die off.

                    I have been trying to embrace a more holistic lifestyle and focusing on having a more natural, low processing and preventative diet. I have opted to reduce my sugar intake and change out to honey. I feel more assure that MTA honey valley is of the purest form as i have seen the GMPs employed by this company and have confidence in their ethical practices. I also used honey in my skin care routine and have been seeing big positive changes
